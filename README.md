# The Seaclam Project
The Seaclam Project is a fork of Landon's original tool which was flagged recently. I did not make this tool, but I made a few personal preference changes to the site.
# How to use
After logging in, you are greeted with a typing site interface. Click Sign In, and where it asks for email, type in the same password used before. You will now be able to use the tool as before.
